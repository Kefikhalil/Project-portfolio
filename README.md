<br>
The smart AI wish is represented in the first picture it's an animated AI that walk patroling an certain area, that yellow cube is a target. The AI will be walking arround different targets that the player cannot see while playing , whenever the AI arrive to a target a checking animation will be casted but what really make him feel smart is that there is alot of targets in the map in a huge area and he target switching is random so you may never see an AI following the same path again , also you may never find him in the same position in the map. Also the AI is able to detect the player and get into a chase mode.
